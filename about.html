<h3>Who I am?</h3>
<p>Hi again! My name is Vadim and I`m from Russia but currently living in France, Nantes. In 2014 I finished high-school in my native country, and I aimed to study in university of St.Petersburg to become an <a href="">architect</a>. But my life extremely changed in a moment and I decided to go in France to prepare my BAC in science degree (examen for French students to pursue university studies).</p>  
<p>So I spend 2 years yet in a high-school learning French. We studied a lot of electronics and maths, in the same time I dived in a world of computer science with simple HTML and CSS. It`s became my passion, I subscribed on a resources like <a href="https://htmlacademy.ru/" target="_blank">HTML Academy</a> to have access for a more advanced css cources, and I accomplished some of <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Code Academy</a> lessons.
</p>  
<p>After first year in France, I had to decide where I will go next. In this moment I spent a lot of time on programming, so I decided to left the idea of becoming architect (the higher education for architects was very expensive for me) and push my efforts in what I`m currently loving to do. I succefully graduated and proceeded in a University of Nantes. Now I`m an on my way to become full-stack web developer after passing there 3 years where I did the most of my projects.</p>
<p>The programming isn`t the single thing that I love to do. I spend the most of my school age learning music - piano, guitar (and also drums now), you can see my old covers if you love something like <a href="https://youtu.be/Pov5hVABT2g" target = "_blank">Nirvana</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/eBjU56DNWBw" target = "_blank">Slipknot</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/lcdWInkxAFI" target = "_blank">Sum41</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkaoBqq5nFLPZVF-xw7iHFg" target = "_blank">other stuff</a> on Youtube</p>
<p>When I was 16 years old, I was mad with photography, I started to buy professional lenses and tried to bring more of art in my life. Now it always stays my hobby, and I do some photos from time to time. You can check out my works <a href="https://veax-photos.netlify.com" target = "_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I think you already understood that I speak French (+ 5 years) as many as Russian (bilingual). <del>By the way I try to write all this articles in my perfect English.</del> So if you want to learn more about Russians, our culture or our language, don`t hesitate to <a href="/contacts.html">contact me</a>. I`m always open to new connections.</p>
<p>I suppose that the last thing to tell about me that I love to travel, you could soon find some of my trips in my <a href="/blog.html">blog</a> if you are interested in.</p>

<h3>What I currently do?</h3>
<p>I decided to not pursue a Master`s degree in computer science <cite>(my bad?)</cite> and to stop my studies with Bachelor`s degree - so this year was my last one in university. My type of degree considered 16 weeks internship in a company and constant work after. So after my internship in Capgemini, I'm currently working here as Java Software Developer .</p>
<p>You can see my latest study projects <a href="{{site.baseurl}}work/">here</a>.</p>

<h3>What else?</h3>
<p>Initially this web-page would be to become nothing but my portfolio with the most of projects that I did, but after all it`s something more: it`s my projects, my notes about all what I feel important, my life in digit dimension. So feel free to all types of feedback.</p>
