<p>This code allows to move geometric objects in a graphic window (JFrame library) according to trajectories which defines like a sequence of points. Using practices of POO to manipulate the objects. User can create new forms and trajectories without any change of previous code. For this example was created rectangle, cercle, ellipse which we can move on horizontal/vertical line, a circle or spiral of Archimedes.</p>
