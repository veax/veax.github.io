<p>This is NOT my course, but I learned a lot from this and I contributed to this project on github: <a href="https://github.com/karlhadwen/instagram/pull/1" target="_blank">link to PR</a> </p>
<p>You can follow <a href="https://youtu.be/AKeaaa8yAAk" target="_blank">free version</a> on youtube and also buy a paid version with testing to support Karl. </p>
